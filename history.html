                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">A month-or-so ago, FreeNAS annouced that they were merging with TrueNAS a seperate project, which is very similar to FreeNAS.<br/><br/>
                          As a result, I had to come up with a plan to migrate from FreeNAS to TrueNAS. I decided my best route would be to do a ZFS replication-based migration from FreeNAS to TrueNAS using the built-in replication tools.<br/>
                          After doing so, I attempted, <em>several times</em>, to migrate my NextCloud install from my FreeNAS VM to my TrueNAS VM, but it kept throwing errors, and was unable to be upgraded, so I ended up rebuilding it entirely.<br/>
                          Another thing that was put into consideration was data-redundancy, and protection. I ended up moving my NAS solution from my R410 to my R710 for RAID-based protection.<br/>
                          In the end, I had upgraded to TrueNAS 12.0 and NextCloud 19, a total success, and no important data was lost in the migration. üëç

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">After lengthy planning and strategizing, I had a plan.<br/><br/>
                        Most, if not all, of the patch cables I ran inside the rack connecting the servers to the switch, and connecting the other devices to the network were either ruined, destroyed, or just unfit for reinstallation.<br/>
                        All of the equipment somehow survived, including all the servers, spare networking equipment, and the electrical wiring and circuitry for the rack.<br/>
                        I had to make a decision in regards to how I wanted to re-run, cable, and manage the patch cables on the rack that would be more efficient and cost-effective than last time.<br/><br/>
                        I decided that I would purchase patch cables off Amazon, (Roughly $17/10 10ft Cat-5e, and $15/10 1ft Cat-5e) and also invest in a label printer to label every cable for disassembly/reassembly purposes.<br/>
                        After rewiring the rack, labeling everything, and ensuring cables were secured in a neat and orderly fashion, I was able to effectively bring the lab back to functioning order.<br/>
                        I'm personally pretty happy with how it came out, I now know where each keystone jack goes, the cables are grouped by function and are labled at each end.<br/><br/>
                        Also, that label printer is pretty cool IMHO, totally worth the investment. It prints literally anything and has so many presets.

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">And I thought it was just <em>perfect... Until...</em>.<br/><br/>
                        I was over at my partner's house when I had been notified that my basement (The location of the server rack) was slowly flooding with water that had built up from the non-stop rain we had been getting that week.<br/><br/>
                        In response, I immediately returned home and started removing all of my equipment from the installation location in an effort to save it from liquid exposure.<br/>
                        As a result, I practically <em>ripped</em> the equipment out yanking cabling and scattering everything, leaving the lab in complete chaos and unfunctional.<br/><br/>
                        I struggled to get a feasable internet connection using the little equipment I had, but I managed to hack together a 10/100 Wireless N router with DD-WRT on it to patch into our modem downstairs to provide internet to my parents.<br/><br/>
                        As for my lab, I had some work to do to bring it back into service after we corrected the flooding issue...

                        Considering getting that JBOD running, I did the math and it can handle 26TB alltogether if I decided to run it in the lab for additional space.
